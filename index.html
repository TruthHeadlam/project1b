Earlier this year New York became one of the sanctuary states housing 11,300 asylum seekers and counting. “No migrants, no tents'' was the slogan for a bipartisan protest at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn after Mayor Eric Adams announced that the field would become a shelter for more than 2,000 of those asylum seekers on Sep.18 as a result of a lease agreement between the city and the federal government.

<p class="regulartext"> A crowd of no less than 100 people turned out to the protest led by former mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa (Rep.) and radio personality Sid Rosenberg of WABC on the evening of Sep.14 at the far end of the field near the entrance of the Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge in Brooklyn.</p>

“This was not probable or possible. This was inevitable,” stated Rosenberg who emceed the protest. “We’re very aggravated, not with the migrants but with the public officials that continue to allow this and ruin two of our best neighborhoods. This is a very community-minded park with lots of kid activities and they're gonna ruin the whole thing.”

Floyd Bennet Field has gone through several changes for its use; it was the state’s first municipal airport, a World War II naval station, and is presently a part of the Gateway National Recreation Area, according to the National Park Service. The field stretches across Flatbush Avenue approaching the Brooklyn-Queens border and is home to several indoor and outdoor recreational activities, as well as after-school activities, many of which are hosted by Aviators Sports and Events Center.

“We have 30 different schools in Aviators. Everyday people are calling my office concerned about their kids going there,” stated Assembly Member Jamie R. Williams (Dem.) who represents District 59. “We need to close our borders. We cannot sustain this,” she continued while urging  the crowd to vote in all upcoming elections and instructing them to continue chanting the phrase “Close our borders!”

“As you know we’re representing both sides of the bridge here. But we are at the point where I call for a day of action,” Sliwa stated as the hour-long protest came to an end. “I can’t announce exactly what we’re gonna do ‘cause I don’t want the cops to prepare,” he continued while recalling a former rally near Toy-R-Us, a short distance from the field, where he claims law enforcement shut the bridge down to protestors but later denied it. “What about if we shut the bridge? Because they ain’t coming over the bridge,” he exclaimed as the crowd roared in agreement.

Other bipartisan acts of protest being taken by the community and elected officials include a lawsuit against the city if they move forward with plans to use the Floyd Bennett Field as a shelter for asylum seekers. This method was also used in Staten Island in August. Although initially successful after a Staten Island judge ruled in favor of blocking the use of a school as a shelter the victory was short-lived after a higher court overturned that decision. A fate that elected officials in Brooklyn risk facing with their lawsuit.
